## App Exercise - Tracking Different Types

You have declared a number of constants and variables to keep track of fitness information. Declare one more variable with a boolean value called `hasMetStepGoal`.

//:  When you declared a constant for goal number of steps and a variable for current step count, you likely assigned each a value in the thousands. This can be difficult to read. Redeclare this constant and variable and, when assigning each a value in the thousands, format the number so that it is more readable.
// didn't get the task well, so tried to make it my way, for me personally, adding decimal zero makes it more readable, but it also can be as 2K or 10K
